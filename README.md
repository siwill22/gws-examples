Examples of how to use the gplates web service

## Contents
Example code showing how to use the gplates web service to get plate reconstructions directly from http requests, using
- matlab
- bash/command line
- python
- R

The jupyter notebooks in the python example are a good place to start since they can be rendered directly in a browser without 
needing to install anything.

See individual scripts for dependencies. Note that the python examples do NOT require pygplates to be installed.

NOTE: the gplates web service is still in a preliminary stage and changing frequently, so the scripts are prone to break as a result
