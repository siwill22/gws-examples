Examples of how to use the gplates web service

## Contents
Example code showing how to use the gplates web service to get plate reconstructions directly from http requests, using
- matlab
- bash/command line
- python (but without needing to have pygplates installed)
- R

See individual scripts for dependencies

NOTE: the gplates web service is still in a preliminary stage and changing frequently, so the scripts are prone to break as a result
